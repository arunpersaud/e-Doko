2) create a config.php file that defines the following variables:

  $host:  for example "http://localhost/index.php", note: include the index.php here

  database info:

    $DB_host 
    $DB_user 
    $DB_password 
    $DB_database 

  working on the database:
    in case you need to work on the database for some reason, you can suspend the game
    by setting $DB_work to 1

    try adding this in config.php

    function	date_default_timezone_set($zone)
    {
       return;
    }
