Installation
------------

-1) What you need
   all you need is PHP and MYSQL. PHP has to include gettext support.

0) Get files

  get all files from

  http://nubati.net/git/e-DoKo

1) Create database

  create a mysql database using the provided file

  mysql < create_database.sql

  use user, password, database and host option of mysql as needed

2) Configure

  Copy config.php_template to config.php and edit it. These variables need to be set:

  $HOST:  for example "http://localhost"
  $INDEX: the absolute web path to your index.php file e.g. "/mypath/index.php"
  $STATS: the absolute web path to your stats.php file e.g. "/mypath/stast.php"
  $RSSS:  the absolute web path to your rss.php file e.g. "/mypath/rss.php"

  database info:

    $DB_host
    $DB_user
    $DB_password
    $DB_database

  working on the database:
    in case you need to work on the database for some reason, you can suspend the game
    by setting $DB_work to 1

  debug mode:
    you can also turn the debug mode on by defining:
    $debug=1;

    this will give some extra output and won't send out emails, but
    display them in the browser

  timezone problem:
    If you hvae problem with the timezone, that is an older PHP version,
    try adding this in config.php

    function	date_default_timezone_set($zone)
    {
       return;
    }

3) Log in and enjoy ;)
